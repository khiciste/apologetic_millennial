        <p class="wrap-text">
          We are in a unique moment in American history. The <span class="hightlight">“Occupy Wall Street”</span>
          movement of September 2011 was an economic reckoning rooted in America’s dissatisfaction with societal
          inequality. More recently, a racial reckoning has been underway, most pronounced after the <span
            class="hightlight">murder of George Floyd</span> on May 25, 2020. <span class="highlight">The January 6th
            insurrection</span> could be considered the apex of a political reckoning that has been occurring since
          the election of former President Trump. Taken separately, each of these events has monumental historical
          significance. Collectively, they are perhaps best understood as part of an <b>ongoing and unrealized moral
            reckoning.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Ultimately, my book, Letters to Uncle David, couldn’t come at a more imperative time:</b> Country-wide
          polarization is at an all-time high and the perils of social media are becoming undeniable. Our current
          default mode has a particular penchant for destroying our shared narrative and pitting us against each
          other. <b>And the youngest among us are most vulnerable, both in the negative consequences of social media
            and the dysfunctional world they are destined to inherit.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          If you’ve ever written someone off because of their politics, or have maddeningly futile political arguments
          and don’t know where to begin to do better, <b>you’ve come to the right place.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>In my book,</b> you’ll find the work of today’s greatest thought leaders woven within the narrative of my
          15-year journey as a Liberal Millennial to better understand my Conservative uncle.
