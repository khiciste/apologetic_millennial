            The Center for Humane Technology
          </a>
          is a nonprofit co-founded by Tristan Harris after he voiced concern about social media's effect on everyday
          lives and human vulnerabilities. The Center for Humane Technology works to expose the drivers behind all
          extractive technologies steering our thoughts, behaviors, and actions and believes that by understanding the
          root causes of harmful technology, we can work together to build a more humane future.
